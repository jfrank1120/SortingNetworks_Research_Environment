# SortingNetworks_Research_Environment
The current environment used for my research in the field of Sorting Networks and their efficency. 
Used for my course CompSci 495 at Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania under the supervision of Dr. Drue Coles.

# Future Implementation
- Possible graphical interface
- Work with the depth of the created network
- Calculations to better describe current efficency of the network
